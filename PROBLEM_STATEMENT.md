# Problem Statement: "The Galactic Alliance’s Secret Communication: Using Mutual TLS to Secure Rebel and Jedi Communication"

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the **Galactic Alliance** and the **Rebel Forces** are on the verge of launching a coordinated strike against the Empire’s latest weapon. The only problem? The Empire has spies everywhere, constantly attempting to intercept secret transmissions between key Rebel bases and the Jedi Order. One leaked communication could spell doom for the entire galaxy.

To safeguard these vital messages, the leaders of the Rebel Alliance have decided to implement a **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** system between their secret base on **Yavin-4** and the Jedi Council’s hidden enclave. This setup will ensure that only trusted servers within each faction can communicate, allowing encrypted, secure transmissions that even the Empire’s most advanced droids cannot crack.

Your mission, as part of the **Rebel Tech Division**, is to establish this mTLS protocol between the two servers—**Rebel Base A (Yavin-4)** and **Jedi Server B (Jedi Council)**—so they can communicate without fear of interception by the Empire’s intelligence units.

## Requirements:
1. **Rebel Base A** and **Jedi Server B** must mutually authenticate each other using trusted certificates from a secure **Galactic Certificate Authority** (GCA).
2. Ensure that the communication is completely encrypted, even if intercepted by the Empire’s Imperial droids or bounty hunters like Boba Fett, so no vital secrets are compromised.
3. Implement a system that allows quick revocation and re-issuance of certificates in case a base is compromised, or the Empire infiltrates the communication network.
4. The system should scale to include other Rebel outposts and Jedi strongholds in the future, as the Alliance grows stronger.
5. This secure communication must resist any advanced Imperial hacking techniques, such as protocol droid infiltrations or the use of the **Empire’s Dark Side encryption-breaking algorithms**.

Will you take up the mantle of securing the galaxy’s hope? With mTLS, the fate of the Rebel Alliance and the Jedi rests in your hands.
